# Neobis_iOS_Calculating
An iPhone calculator is written in UIKit with an interface designed without Storyboard, following the MVVM pattern.

## Description
I've developed a classic iPhone calculator that performs calculations specified by the user. The application interface was constructed without using Storyboard, fully adhering to the standards of the iPhone's calculator design. The application follows the conventional MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Design
The calculator adopts the iPhoneâ€™s standard calculator design, providing users with a familiar and user-friendly experience.

## Architectural Pattern
The app implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Frameworks
- UIKit: The fundamental framework for building the user interface.
- MVVM: Implements the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern for code organization.
- SnapKit: A concise Auto Layout DSL to simplify the layout code.

## How to Use
Once the project is set up, using the calculator is straightforward:
- Open the application on your iOS device or simulator.
- Input numerical values and use the provided arithmetic operations to perform calculations.
- Results will be displayed on the calculator screen.
- Use the provided functionalities to clear the input or modify the current calculation.

## How to Install
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Open the project in your preferred iOS development environment (preferably Xcode).
- Build and run the application on your Apple device or simulator.

## Lessons Learned
During the development of the Neobis iOS Calculating project, several insights and lessons were gained:

- **MVVM Implementation**: Understanding and implementing the MVVM architectural pattern improved code organization and maintainability.
- **Programmatic UI**: Building the interface without Storyboard enhanced proficiency in programmatic UI development.
- **SnapKit Integration**: Working with SnapKit simplified Auto Layout constraints and improved the dynamic layout of the calculator.
